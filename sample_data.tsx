<precaution>
    <notice>If any of the following conditions are met, keep engine idling with A/C on (engine speed at less than 2000 RPM) for at least 1 minute: 
        <condition>Refrigerant gas has been refilled or A/C parts have been replaced.</condition>
        <condition>Long time has elapsed since engine was stopped.</condition>
    </notice>
    <warning>If the engine speed exceeds 2,000 RPM, the A/C compressor may be damaged.</warning>
    <caution>Do not handle refrigerant in enclosed areas or near open flames.</caution>
    <safety>Always wear eye protection.</safety>
    <liquid_refrigerant_warning>Be careful not to get liquid refrigerant in your eyes or on your skin. If liquid refrigerant gets in your eyes or on your skin:
        <action>Wash the area with lots of cold water.</action>
        <action>Do not rub your eyes or skin.</action>
        <action>Apply clean petroleum jelly to the skin.</action>
        <action>Go immediately to a hospital or see a physician for professional treatment.</action>
    </liquid_refrigerant_warning>
    <general_safety>Never heat container or expose it to naked flames.</general_safety>
    <safety>Be careful not to drop container or subject it to physical shocks.</safety>
    <warning>Do not operate compressor with insufficient refrigerant in refrigerant system to avoid oil lubrication issues leading to compressor burnout.</warning>
    <warning>Do not open high-pressure manifold valve while compressor is operating; only open and close the low-pressure valve.</warning>
    <caution>Be careful not to overcharge system with refrigerant to avoid complications like insufficient cooling, poor fuel economy, and engine overheating.</caution>
    <warning>Do not operate engine and compressor without refrigerant to prevent damaging the inside of the compressor.</warning>
</precaution>

<symptom>Insufficient cooling, poor fuel economy, engine overheating</symptom>

<suspect_area>A/C Compressor and Refrigerant System</suspect_area>

<suspect_area_info>
    <info>Insufficient refrigerant can lead to compressor damage due to poor oil lubrication.</info>
    <info>A/C compressor damage can occur from overcharging, overheating, or operating without refrigerant.</info>
</suspect_area_info>

<tests_procedures>
    <test>
        <name>Refrigerant Level Check</name>
        <procedure>Check refrigerant level in the system. Ensure the system has adequate pressure before operating the compressor.</procedure>
    </test>
    <test>
        <name>Cooling Performance Test</name>
        <procedure>Start engine and A/C at less than 2000 RPM for 1 minute. Check vent temperatures to determine cooling effectiveness.</procedure>
    </test>
</tests_procedures>

<additional_info>
    <info>A/C parts include compressor, condenser, evaporator, expansion valve, and associated sensors.</info>
    <info>Temperature sensors monitor interior and ambient conditions, communicating with the ECM for optimal A/C performance.</info>
    <info>Follow manufacturer's guidelines when handling refrigerants and operating the A/C system to ensure safety and effectiveness.</info>
